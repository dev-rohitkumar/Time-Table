# 🎓 5th Semester Timetable - Web Dev Edition

This project is a creative and practical recreation of my 5th Semester college timetable using **HTML** and **CSS**. Instead of managing it in Excel (read: chaos), I decided to use my Web Development skills to build a cleaner, responsive, and more visually appealing version of it — and also revise some key frontend concepts along the way!

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Built entirely with HTML and CSS
- 🎨 Styled with custom fonts, shadows, and colors for a clean look
- 🧠 Great for practicing:
  - HTML Tables
  - CSS Grid/Flexbox concepts
  - Responsive layout techniques
  - Custom styling and formatting

## 🤹‍♂️ Bonus: A Sprinkle of Humor

Because every semester needs a little comic relief:
- `box-shadow` added to improve the timetable more than I’ve improved my sleep schedule 😴
- `flex` saved the layout better than I’ve saved my GPA
- Timetable layout is more complex than CSS `position: relative;`

## 📁 Files

## 💡 Why I Built This

Instead of letting a confusing timetable ruin my day, I turned it into an opportunity to:
- Apply what I’m learning in Web Development
- Make something real and useful
- Add a touch of fun to the chaos of college life
